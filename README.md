English Premier League Data - 2019/2020 EPL Player Market Values &amp; Game by Game Statistics

The purpose of this project is to assemble in depth statistics and information by player and club for the following purposes:

1. Provide real-time and in-depth statistics and probabilities to leverage as betting information. 
This will consist of general statistics, probability theory as well as the implementation of ML algorithms to predict outcomes. 

2. Having a background in Econometrics, I would like to tie in Economic metrics in relation to the specific clubs' cities and evaluate 
whether or not I am able to find a correlation and possibly prove causation between a clubs performance and certain metrics such as 
productivity, output or happiness.

3. Further explore the relationships between certain performance metrics and the values of players. Where do market inefficiencies appear
to exist when it comes to properly identify the value of a player. Perhaps we can ask questions such as, what ethnicities or nationalities
appear to be overvalued or undervalued due to club/scout biases
